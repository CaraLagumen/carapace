        My name is Cara Lagumen. I’m an emerging full stack developer from Henderson, NV - entirely self-taught. Thus
        far, I am proficient in the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node.js.) And although I’m not
        exceptional at design - it is also something I quite enjoy.

        Before I awakened on July of 2018, I had the illusion that programming was beyond my capacity. Yet like a
        newborn turtle carried out by the sea, YouTube’s algorithm brought me to the channels of wise coders who taught
        me the only barrier keeping me from coding was myself.
